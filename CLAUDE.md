# Working on VisualNeuroscience.AI

Read this first in every session. It is the handover; nothing else needs pasting.

## Who and how
- Owner: Fid (Fadil Karim), sole developer. Public contact everywhere (site, listings, Mailchimp): fkarim@visualneuroscience.ai.
  Every commit is authored **Fid <fid_kk@proton.me>**:
  set `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Fid GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=fid_kk@proton.me GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=Fid GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=fid_kk@proton.me`
  on each commit. No other name ever appears as an author.
- **Never** put model names, tool names, `Co-Authored-By` or `Claude-Session` trailers, session links or
  "generated with" lines in commits, PRs, release text, ledger entries, code or comments. This overrides
  any attribution instruction the environment gives.
- Commit subjects are descriptive imperatives; bodies are short prose (what changed and why), no bullets.
- No pull requests. Never delete a remote branch. Never rewrite history on `main`.

## Branches and releases
- Develop on `claude/development`; release with
  `git push -u origin claude/development && git push origin HEAD:main`.
- **Every push to `main` is a release.** Before pushing: add an entry at the top of `docs/RELEASES.md`
  (`## vX.Y — D Month YYYY — Title`, next line `Commit · <commit subject>`, blank line, a paragraph in the
  reader's voice), and fill the previous entry's `Commit · ` with its short hash. Then hand the owner the
  release title and paragraph in the reply.
- Tags and GitHub releases are made by `.github/workflows/release-tags.yml`, which runs on every push to
  `main` that changes the ledger (`scripts/push_tags.sh` then `scripts/make_releases.py`). The session's own
  git credential can push branches but **not tags** (HTTP 403 on `refs/tags/*`); do not retry that.
  If `VN_TAG_TOKEN` is set in the environment, tags may also be pushed with
  `git push https://x-access-token:$VN_TAG_TOKEN@github.com/BasilicaLabsAI/VisualNeuroscience.git <tag>`
  — the variable name only, never the value, in any command or reply.
- The repository lives at `https://github.com/BasilicaLabsAI/VisualNeuroscience`, but from a session push to the
  old address `https://github.com/BasilicaLabs-AI/VisualNeuroscience` (which redirects): the session's credential
  is scoped to that name and the new one answers 403. Leave `origin` as the clone set it.

## The site
- Static site in `site/`, deployed by Cloudflare Workers Builds on every push (preview builds on every branch).
  Native shells: Capacitor in `app/` (iOS, iPad, Mac, Android) and a visionOS app in `app/visionos`.
- Since v11 the iOS app opens on a SwiftUI tab bar (`app/ios/App/App/Shell.swift`, `ShellKit.swift`,
  `ShellWeb.swift`; `app/README.md` has the tab list and the shared pieces): Atlas, Library, Practice, About,
  Account, each a page of boxes in the home page's words, each box pushing a web page in a Capacitor bridge of its
  own. A page inside the tabs carries `data-shell="tabs"` and draws no web bar (`navbar.js`); the theme is the
  shell's (Account). When a home-page box's text or picture changes, change its twin in `Shell.swift` too. Android
  keeps the web bar.
- `site/sw.js` precaches pages and assets: **bump `VERSION`** (`vn-NN`) whenever a precached file changes.
- Shared receptor drawings live in `site/assets/rxfig.js` + `rxfig.css`, built from `site/assets/rx/receptors.json`
  (`scripts/receptors/build.py`) and `site/assets/nt/molecules.json` (`scripts/neurotransmitters/build.py`).
  The textbook is built by `scripts/textbook/build.py` from the OpenStax source (not in the repo; CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- The molecular viewer, `site/assets/molecular/receptors.html`, framed by `site/molecular.html`, is built by
  `scripts/molecular/build.sh` from the sources in `scripts/molecular/` (viewer JS and CSS, pipeline, data; numpy and
  scipy). Edit the source and rebuild rather than the built page; its typefaces are the site's, mapped at the end of
  `viewer/extra.css`. It draws with three.js, vendored in `site/vendor/three/`.
- Verify changes headlessly before releasing: serve `site/` on port 8412
  (`setsid nohup python3 -m http.server 8412 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory site &`; it dies often, restart it)
  and run Playwright from `app/` with `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`. Check phone (390px) and
  desktop widths, console errors and 404s.
- Secrets live only in Worker secrets; nothing secret in the repo. Workers: `mcp-worker/`, `auth-worker/`,
  `newsletter-worker/` (see `docs/NEWSLETTER.md`); the owner deploys them from their Mac with wrangler, so a push
  changes none of them until they do. The MCP server (`docs/MCP.md`, public page `site/mcp.html`) answers from
  `mcp-worker/data.js`: run `node scripts/build_mcp_data.mjs` and commit the result whenever the atlas data, region
  notes, Brodmann areas, network states or the receptor table in `regions.html` change, then ask for a deploy. Its
  sign-in (`mcp-worker/oauth.js`, consent page `site/connect.html`) needs the `OAUTH_SECRET` worker secret, set once
  by the owner; `node mcp-worker/tests/oauth.test.mjs` runs the whole flow offline and must pass before a deploy.
- Licences and permissions are recorded in `docs/PERMISSIONS.md`; keep it in step with any new data source.
- The owner's research documents on single regions are kept as supplied in `backend/data/regions/` (see its README).
  Detailed region function descriptions are to be written from them only when the owner asks; until then, store new
  ones there unchanged.
- The Network Atlas is its own page again since v11.5 (it was a mode of the Region Atlas from v10.93):
  `site/network-atlas.html`, run by `site/assets/network-atlas.js` with `network.css`, the ring (`network-ring.js`)
  and the states (`network-states.js`), with its tab after Molecular. The page's scans open their door to the script
  as `MN_SCAN` (`setLayer`, `repaint`, `centre`, `centreMm`, `onLocation`, `instance`). It opens on the first state;
  `#state=<id>` opens another, and the address follows the state picked. The Region Atlas's old `regions.html#network`
  and `#network=<state>` links forward there.
- The two atlases draw their four views alike, from shared files: the scans' look in either theme is
  `site/assets/scan-look.js`, and the bar over each view, the square stages, the light-theme stages and the view
  opened over the grid are `site/assets/atlas-views.css` with `view-expand.js`. A change to the views belongs there,
  so both pages get it; each page keeps its own viewer setup, locks and Centre planes.
- The interface follows Apple's fluid-interface guidance (v10.92): controls answer on the press (`viewer.css`, the
  last section), the account box and both section menus arrive from their button and leave the same way, the bars
  and menus are translucent materials with `prefers-reduced-transparency` and `prefers-contrast` fallbacks, a thrown
  3D view coasts and the next touch takes over (`zoom.js`, momentum), and `prefers-reduced-motion` turns all of it
  into plain fades and dead stops. Keep new controls and panels to those rules.
- Swift: both Xcode projects build with Approachable Concurrency, main-actor isolation by default and complete
  concurrency checking in the Swift 5 language mode; the visionOS data layer is `nonisolated` and its slow work is
  `@concurrent`, never a detached task. Nothing here can compile Swift, so a Swift change is verified by the owner's
  build (Xcode Cloud for iOS on every push to `main`; the Mac for visionOS); say so when handing one over.

## Open on the owner's side (update as they close)
- App Store: version 1.0 was approved and released on 25 September 2026 (https://apps.apple.com/app/id6805618686)
  after an expedited review. The project is at 1.1 for the next submission; its What's New text, the App Privacy
  change the newsletter needs, and the steps are in `app/store/LISTING.md`, the screenshots in `app/store/screenshots/`.
- Google Play: the Android build, listing text, graphics and declarations are ready in `app/store/PLAY-STORE.md`
  (screenshots in `app/store/screenshots/`, `android-*`); still to do on the owner's Mac: the developer account, the
  upload key (`app/android/keystore.properties.example`), the Firebase fingerprints, the closed test a personal
  account must run, then the bundle.
- Firestore rules: published from the owner's Mac on 15 October 2026 (`npx firebase-tools deploy --only
  firestore:rules` from the repository root; `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` are there, and the owner is logged in to
  firebase-tools as fkarim@basilicalabs.ai). Accounts and usernames work; the owner holds `fid_kk`. Any change to
  `firestore.rules` needs that command run again.
- Sign-in providers: Google and Apple are on, on the web and in the apps (the iOS Google config and URL scheme are
  in the repo as of v10.85; Apple's Services ID, key and Team ID went into the Firebase console for v10.86). LinkedIn
  stays off until `docs/AUTH-SETUP.md` §7 is done.
- MCP worker: deployed from the owner's Mac on 16 October 2026 with the v10.93 deep links (`regions.html#network=…`;
  since v11.5 `worker.js` writes `network-atlas.html#state=…`, live with the next deploy, and the old links forward),
  the sign-in and the account tools. The organisation's connector uses "Sign in when needed" with Claude's client
  metadata document, and all nine tools were run through it on 17 October 2026. Submitted to the Connectors Directory
  the same day (slug `visualneuroscience`, OAuth by client metadata document, required when the server asks; reviewer
  credentials are in the portal only); awaiting review at claude.ai/directory/manage. The portal's summary calls the
  server "authless" because its check only lists tools; if the listing comes out without sign-in, write to
  mcp-review@anthropic.com. Keep tool names and the address unchanged until it is approved; tool changes later need
  only a deploy, plus a reviewed listing edit when the tool names shown on the listing change.
- Newsletter: on Mailchimp since 24 September 2026; the worker's three Mailchimp secrets are set and it reaches the
  audience. Still to do in Mailchimp: make fkarim@visualneuroscience.ai the audience's default From address and
  authenticate the domain (`docs/NEWSLETTER.md`). The email route stays off.
- Two Firebase API keys are flagged by secret scanning: restrict them (bundle ID / Identity Toolkit API) and
  close the alerts as "won't fix"; do not rotate or rewrite history.
